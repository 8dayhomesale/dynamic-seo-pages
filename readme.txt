Generate a ton of SEO content instantly with dynamic child pages.

== Description ==

Dynamic SEO Child Pages allows you to create an infinite amount of content for SEO purposes. Simply create a new Dynamic SEO Child Page, choose the "base page", enter a variable URL, and insert shortcode variables into your content.

A great use case for the plugin is locations. Let's say you have a page "Locations" located at "http://yoursite.com/locations". You'd like to create child pages for "http://yoursite.com/locations/location-1", "http://yoursite.com/locations/location-2", etc. This would be extremely time consuming to do manually!

With Dynamic SEO Child Pages, you create one Dynamic SEO Child Page and set it's Base Page to "Locations". Now "http://yoursite.com/locations/...." will point to your Dynamic SEO Child Page. "...." is available as a shortcode, [dscp_variable], in your page so you can insert the location being used making your content dynamic and not duplicated.

Dynamic SEO Child Pages works perfectly with Yoast SEO.
