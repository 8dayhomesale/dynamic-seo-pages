Generate a ton of SEO content instantly with dynamic child pages.

== Description ==

Dynamic SEO Child Pages allows you to create an infinite amount of content for SEO purposes. Simply create a new Dynamic SEO Child Page, choose the __Base Page__, enter a __Variable URL__, and insert shortcode variables into your content.

A great use case for the plugin is locations. Let's say you have a page __"Locations"__ located at __"http://yoursite.com/locations"__. You'd like to create child pages for __"http://yoursite.com/locations/location-1"__, __"http://yoursite.com/locations/location-2"__, etc. This would be extremely time consuming to do manually!

With Dynamic SEO Child Pages, you create one Dynamic SEO Child Page and set it's Base Page to __"Locations"__. Now __"http://yoursite.com/locations/...."__ will point to your Dynamic SEO Child Page. __"...."__ is available as a shortcode, __[dscp_variable]__, in your page so you can insert the location being used making your content dynamic and not duplicated.

Dynamic SEO Child Pages works perfectly with Yoast SEO.
